# CodingChallenge
 The coding challenge for application to student coding job

Time taken: about 2.5 hours. I forgot to write down what time I started but it was about 11:15 and I finished around 1:45. I forgot to take away some debugging things so i made some edits around 1:55 and uploaded the new exe

I didn't write down any notes, I just coded as I read the instructions.
